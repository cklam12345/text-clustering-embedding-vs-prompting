1. Topic Modeling Agent:
* Responsible for preprocessing the text data (e.g., tokenization, stopwords removal)
* Applies topic modeling techniques (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Non-Negative Matrix Factorization) to extract underlying topics
* Output: Topic-word distribution matrices
2. Embedding Agent:
* Receives topic-word distribution matrices from the Topic Modeling Agent
* Generates dense vector representations (embeddings) for each paper using techniques like Word2Vec or Doc2Vec
* Output: Paper embeddings
3. Similarity Calculation Agent:
* Calculates similarity scores between paper embeddings using cosine similarity or other distance metrics
* Output: Similarity matrix
4. Clustering Agent:
* Receives the similarity matrix from the Similarity Calculation Agent
* Applies hierarchical clustering algorithms (e.g., agglomerative, divisive) to group papers into clusters
* Output: Hierarchical clustering tree
5. Validation Agent:
* Evaluates the quality of the clustering results using internal validation metrics (e.g., silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz index)
* Provides feedback to the Clustering Agent for parameter tuning or algorithm selection
6. Topic Refining Agent:
* Analyzes the cluster labels and topic-word distributions to identify emerging topics or subtopics
* Refines the topic models and updates the paper embeddings accordingly
7. Visualization Agent:
* Receives the final clustering results and generates interactive visualizations (e.g., dendrograms, heatmaps) to facilitate exploration and analysis by humans

This team of AI agents can work together to efficiently and effectively perform hierarchical clustering of research papers, leveraging their complementary strengths to produce high-quality results
